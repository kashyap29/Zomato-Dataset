In this project I will be doing Exploratory Data Analysis using Python libraries Numpy & Pandas and also done visualization with the use of matplotlib library.
For doing EDA, this all things I will do,

1) Find Missing values
2) Explore about the numerical variables
3) Explore about categorical variables

I have hereby used bar chart and pie chart for creating visualization.
